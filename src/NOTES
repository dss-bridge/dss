Changes made
------------
Cut size of MAXALT and MAXDEF to 7d 6a
Don't pass vectors by value
FixRanks unused
SetMaxOppRank can then go, too
AltList::CompareMulti change

16600, sum 23977


Algorithm bugs
--------------
13, a65642 (why ever yield 5 tricks?)
def0: AB4T
def1: AA4T or AP56
def0 in total is worse, so defense should prefer it.
CompareMultiSide() must learn this.

10, 0x81aa
    AKJT
-        9
    Q8765
Currently yields
AP5Q or
PB5J or
PA1A + AP4Q
Should just be BB5Q.
21.09.15: Currently actually fails!! (standalone)

11, 0xa4f3
    AKQ85
764       9
    JT
Currently yields BA5Q or AB5J (right),
but no table -- why?
Currently fails (kind of)!!


Table issues
------------
6, 0x92
    AKT
-         J
    Q9
Currently yields BA3K or AB3Q (right),
BB3Q by table (wrong -- why not flagged?)

9, 0xa252
    AJ7
-         98
    KQT6
BB4Q by solver, BB4K by table (why not flagged?)

10, 0x212a9
    AQT
-         J5
    K9876
Currently yields BB5Q directly (which is right),
BB5K by table.

13, 2e630
    AKQJ532
94        7
    T86
Currently yields BA7Q or AB7T (right),
BB7T by table (wrong)

13, 0x222e1
    AKQJ973
5        2
    T864
Currently yields BA7K or AB7T directly,
BB7T by complex table(?).  Why is this not flagged as diff?

----------
DefList:
* Can we cache header at MoveList level, so not store in DL?
* MergeSides needs to become quite intelligent (d=10 case)

AltList:

AltMatrix1D:
* Only have matrix at all when debugging.

TrickList:
* EES not quite happy with this.

Segment:
* Try comparing some of them by "trick", not by header
* Can the comparisons become table lookup?  Should they?  Profile.
  - One for parallel plays
  - One for additive plays (Prepend) (last or non-last segment)

Reduction thoughts:
* Distinguish NT and suit play?!  Seems tough
* Defense leads to first trick

Approach:
* Get the simple counts down to 0
* Get the less-simple counts down to 0

SimpleMoves:
* Move the full-suit stuff before the stopped ones
  (will the full-suit code then get new cases causing
  it to fail?)
* SimpleMove loop into a function that can be called separately,
  returning a histogram.  Only in some cases do we then twiddle
  or otherwise expand
* Does loop have to be over declLen, or can we go to 2 loops, not 3?

LoopHold:
* Split full-suit combos out of the 64 functions into
  64 other functions
* Have a single central dispatch function which returns
  one of three histogram codes if it works
* Check that all branches are still active; renumber


General:
* Profile Guided Optimization, blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2008/11/12/pogo.aspx
  msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fsk896zz.aspx
* No more const #define's
* Also compile with g++
* Make command-line interface so that we "never" have to recompile

----------
Stopped28(): Rewrite with pa, pl, pp, pr

Call it HIST_STOPPED
Think about a HIST_SYMM (EQUAL and also DIFF)

25.05.15
--------
CashoutPard() must also deal with one-sided cashes.
So it must return something that enables BAnr.


Hashing
-------
a. Trick (maxTricks 4 bits, cashTricks 2*4 bits)
b. Rank (maxRanks 4 bits, cashRanks 2*4 bits)
c. Case (something with d and a)
d. Minrank (b with minRanks, 4 bits more)

        Bits    Reduced rbits   Buckets Avg length
a       12      132      8       132    210.94  Trick
b       12      399      9                      Rank
c                20      5                      Case
d       16      593     10                      Minrank

a*b                     17      1859     17.64
a*c                     13       371    100.50
b*c                     14       907     54.64  RankCase
a*d                     18      2384     11.68
c*d

a*(b*c)                 18      3100      9.90
a*(c*d)                 19?     3725      7.11
a*(c*d)                 19?     3442      6.72  With fix

The move structs have now gotten so large that they take a long 
time to copy around.


Output files
------------
Loop over NUMBOTTOMS to see when low ranks matter.
determine overall size of two file tables
output the moves (how many) as code to compile, or as third table?
functions for writing and reading them
time the lookup of all individual suits (no caching)
choose a sensible cutoff between file size and speed
