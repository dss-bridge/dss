Thoughts on two-move data structure
-----------------------------------
ListEntry gets *defp1, *defp2, no1, no1, *next.
singleType should probably have a *listp (to a ListEntry),
  not a *defp.
PrintMove* should go by sl, c.
DefList::PrintMove: would be nice to have a two-move format.
AddMoves always gets two moves, of which one may be NULL.
MoveList has 3 different hashes.

Should def1 have only QT_ACE, def2 only QT_PARD?  Would be nice.

ListEntry might become an object.
We can set it with two defense -- it might or might not merge them.
We can query for tricks and ranks, perhaps.



DONE
====
TrickList.{cpp,h}
Trick.{cpp,h}
Segment.{cpp,h}
AltList.{cpp,h}
AltMatrix1D.{cpp,h}
AltMatrix2D.{cpp,h}
Header.{cpp,h}

TODO (core)
====
DefList.{cpp,h}
- MergeSides
- Effect on GetHeader and GetKey

PLAN
====
* Get the algorithmic parts completely clean and solid

Is everything in cst.h still needed?

Other code
----------

**** Think about storage for QT_ACE and QT_PARD separately,
     and also LHO/RHO (single 32b field, at least A/P?)

Reduction thoughts:
* Distinguish NT and suit play?!  Seems tough
* Defense leads to first trick

Approach:
* Get the simple counts down to 0
* Get the less-simple counts down to 0

SimpleMoves:
* Move the full-suit stuff before the stopped ones
  (will the full-suit code then get new cases causing
  it to fail?)
* SimpleMove loop into a function that can be called separately,
  returning a histogram.  Only in some cases do we then twiddle
  or otherwise expand
* Does loop have to be over declLen, or can we go to 2 loops, not 3?

LoopHold:
* Split full-suit combos out of the 64 functions into
  64 other functions
* Have a single central dispatch function which returns
  one of three histogram codes if it works
* Check that all branches are still active; renumber


General:
* Profile Guided Optimization, blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2008/11/12/pogo.aspx
  msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fsk896zz.aspx
* No more const #define's
* Also compile with g++
* Make command-line interface so that we "never" have to recompile

Stopped28(): Rewrite with pa, pl, pp, pr

Call it HIST_STOPPED
Think about a HIST_SYMM (EQUAL and also DIFF)

CashoutPard() must also deal with one-sided cashes.
So it must return something that enables BAnr.


Hashing
-------
a. Trick (maxTricks 4 bits, cashTricks 2*4 bits)
b. Rank (maxRanks 4 bits, cashRanks 2*4 bits)
c. Case (something with d and a)
d. Minrank (b with minRanks, 4 bits more)

        Bits    Reduced rbits   Buckets Avg length
a       12      132      8       132    210.94  Trick
b       12      399      9                      Rank
c                20      5                      Case
d       16      593     10                      Minrank

a*b                     17      1859     17.64

b*c                     14       907     54.64  RankCase
a*d                     18      2384     11.68
c*d

a*(b*c)                 18      3100      9.90
a*(c*d)                 19?     3725      7.11
a*(c*d)                 19?     3442      6.72  With fix

The move structs have now gotten so large that they take a long 
time to copy around.


Output files
------------
Loop over NUMBOTTOMS to see when low ranks matter.
determine overall size of two file tables
output the moves (how many) as code to compile, or as third table?
functions for writing and reading them
time the lookup of all individual suits (no caching)
choose a sensible cutoff between file size and speed
